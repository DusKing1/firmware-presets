### Regions
Regions are optional directives. They can be used to mark a group of CLI commands and give a name for this group. They are similar to C# preprocessor directive `#region`.
When a CLI preset contains regions, a Configurator user will see a list of available regions by their names. This list will appear in the preset dialog once a specific preset is selected. User will be able to select desired regions to apply.

An example of using regions is a BNF quad preset. Manufacturer could add different regions for different radio protocols such as SBUS, Crossfire, Ghost, etc. In this case, a user will be able to select his radio protocol when he applies this preset together with different rc_smoothing settings.

A region starts with `# region begin <region name>` directive. It can be extended with `(checked)` or `(unchecked)` to specify whether this region should be selected by default or not.
Every region should be closed with `# region end`. Between `# region begin <region name>` and `# region end` there is a list of CLI commands included in the region.
Nested regions are not allowed yet.
Regions could be split into multiple parts although it is not recommended for readability.

If you `# include` a preset with the regions inside, these regions will not appear in the final preset.
If you still want to include them, you have to add a dummy region declarations like:
```
# region begin <region name>
# region end
```

Using `# include` is allowed within the region and works as expected:
```
# region begin <region name>
# include file/to/include.txt
# region end
```
